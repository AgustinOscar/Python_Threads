# Python_Threads

In this repository there are different python scripts to understand the basic use of threads in python.

Each of the scripts is executed independently of the others, how about therefore, each of them explains a specific topic on the threads themselves.

To execute each of the scripts, simply enter the command from the terminal:

python script_name.py

Example:

  python thread_statement.py
